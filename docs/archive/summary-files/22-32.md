# EvoAITest – Claude Sonnet 4.5 Prompts: Days 22–32

This document provides ready-to-use descriptive prompts (no code) for Claude Sonnet 4.5 to guide implementation of your EvoAITest Aspire app for days 22 to 32 of your development plan. Each day’s prompt is focused, actionable, and tailored for rapid progress within the AI-powered, Azure-hosted, distributed browser automation architecture.

## Week 4: Advanced AI Agent and LLM Capabilities

### **Day 22: Advanced LLM Provider Integration**
**Prompt:**  
You are upgrading EvoAITest’s LLM layer to include new providers and advanced Azure OpenAI GPT-5 features.
- Add support for multi-model routing (e.g., route to “gpt-5” for planning, “qwen2.5-7b” for code generation).
- Implement automatic fallback to Ollama if Azure OpenAI is rate-limited/offline.
- Enable response streaming for large LLM outputs.
- Ensure secure, production-grade key management (use Azure Key Vault and managed identity).
- Update provider factory, configuration, and add unit tests for switching/routing logic.
- Add rich XML documentation for every interface and method.

### **Day 23: Prompt Engineering Toolkit**
**Prompt:**  
Design a prompt building toolkit in EvoAITest.LLM that simplifies construction and templating of LLM prompts.
- Implement modular prompt constructs for instruction, context, and tool definitions.
- Add prompt versioning and the ability to select different system instructions at runtime.
- Make prompt injection protection default (sanitize and review user components).
- Unit test: assert correct template expansion, safe escaping, and LLM output fidelity.

### **Day 24: Planner Agent v2 (Chain-of-Thought, Plan Visualization)**
**Prompt:**  
Upgrade PlannerAgent with chain-of-thought reasoning.
- Direct Claude Sonnet/OpenAI to document its planning rationale step-by-step in natural language before outputting the formal plan.
- Parse and persist both “thought process” and structured plan.
- Enable visualization support: output JSON or Graphviz DOT for step relationship graphs.
- Add comprehensive tests for both plan and rationale handling.

### **Day 25: Executor Agent v2 (Parallel & Interruptible Execution)**
**Prompt:**  
Enhance ExecutorAgent to run certain steps in parallel where no data dependency exists and allow interruption via cancellation token or external API call.
- Detect independent steps in plan and group for concurrent execution.
- Implement safe, thread-aware resource handling.
- Add test cases for success/failure in parallelized scenarios and safe interruption/cancellation.

### **Day 26: Healer Agent v2 (LLM-based Root Cause Analysis)**
**Prompt:**  
Extend HealerAgent to generate root cause explanations and propose alternative selectors, timing, or interaction models.
- Integrate Claude with page context, error messages, previous screenshots, and prior healing attempts.
- Persist a history of healing strategies.
- Add test scenarios where SLA-based healing or user feedback drives the retry strategy.

### **Day 27: Automated End-to-End Evaluation**
**Prompt:**  
Implement a framework for automatic evaluation of new planners, executors, and healers in EvoAITest.Tests.
- Structure test descriptions as YAML or JSON in a “test_cases” folder.
- Enable new tests to run as full E2E flows (prompt → plan → execute → heal) using both real browser and mock agents.
- Generate evaluation metrics (success, latency, user-like outcomes).
- Output HTML or Markdown coverage reports.

## Week 5: Persistence, Collaboration, and API Expansion

### **Day 28: Task Sharing & Collaboration**
**Prompt:**  
Enable sharing of automation tasks and plans between users.
- Implement secure task sharing links or tokens.
- Add API endpoints and authorization for “viewer” or “collaborator” access to tasks/plans.
- Document in OpenAPI and generate example workflows for cross-user collaboration.

### **Day 29: Rich Plan Editing & Comments**
**Prompt:**  
Design a threaded comment and plan edit/proposal system for EvoAITest.Web.
- Allow users to suggest plan edits, leave comments on steps, and resolve discussions.
- Persist comment/edit data in the same storage as plans (SQL/NoSQL as appropriate).
- Generate API endpoints for retrieving, posting, and moderating comments and proposals.

### **Day 30: Integration with External Data Sources**
**Prompt:**  
Integrate EvoAITest with at least one external system (e.g., Google Sheets, Office 365, Slack, RESTful API).
- Design browser tools and API endpoints for authenticated data import/export.
- Document OAuth and connection prerequisites.
- Generate sample browser automation flows that incorporate external data.

### **Day 31: Scheduled & Event-Driven Automation**
**Prompt:**  
Implement scheduled task support and event-driven triggers.
- Add support for CRON-like scheduling and integration with Azure Event Grid.
- Implement background processing service for queued/scheduled executions.
- Add API/user interface for managing schedules and triggers.
- Document event formats and scheduling syntax.

### **Day 32: Multi-Tenancy and Org Support**
**Prompt:**  
Upgrade EvoAITest for organizational multi-tenancy.
- Add organization/user lookup, scoped database queries, and tenant-aware authentication.
- Update API/model layers (task, execution, comments) to be tenant-aware.
- Add API and UI for organization and membership management.
- Add integration and security tests for org boundary checks.

## 🎯 How to Use These Prompts

For each day:
1. Copy the relevant day’s prompt into Claude Sonnet 4.5 or your preferred LLM.
2. Let the LLM generate code or design based on your architecture and EvoAITest conventions.
3. Review the output, adapt as needed, and copy to your project.
4. Run/commit test cases as required; ensure each change is unit/integration tested.
5. Update your internal documentation to cover each new capability.

All prompts are oriented to Claude Sonnet 4.5 and tailored for your Aspire app (Azure/OpenAI/Ollama), automated agents, and API-first architecture.
